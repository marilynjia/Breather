THE BREATHER APP 

This is a mobile app I conceptualized sometime in late 2022 while doomscrolling in bed! I've tried a lot of productivity and screen time limits, but the one thing I've noticed is that they all make hard shields: Apps blocked. Blank screen. Put in the password to continue scrolling.

Usually, I spend time on my phone because I'm stressed or tired... looking at those shields just made me feel worse. My goal is to create a screen time platform that actively guides the user through journalling, step counting, meditating, etc. until they *want* to turn the screen off.

This repo is a brief proof-of-concept that allows the user to set a screen time limit on their game, and then choose an activity to complete before they keep playing. 

Currently being rebuilt for iOS with ScreenTime API under @mynjia!
